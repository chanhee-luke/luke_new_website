I was very fortunate to receive guidance from many amazing senior PhDs in the early stage of my research, including [Yuan Yao](https://yaoyuanthu.github.io) and [Weicheng Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=njnBrb4AAAAJ&hl=ja). 
Therefore, I am willing to offer similar support to junior students when they feel my mentoring could be useful:

- Renze Lou (ZUCC BS → PSU PhD); 2019-2022; Instruction Tuning

- Jian Xie (ZUCC BS → FDU MS); 2019-Present; Tool-Augmented LLMs, Language Agent

- Yuxuan Sun (ZUCC BS → ZJU PhD); 2019-Present; Multimodality, Medical AI

- Tinghui Zhu (FDU BS → FDU MS); 2023-Present; Reasoning

To date, in all collaborations with junior students, they have received first authorship.

(New) Due to limited bandwidth, I am no longer mentoring undergrads/masters unless we've been in touch before, or you can commit to at least a one-year research duration for high-impact topic explorations.
