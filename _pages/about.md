# About me

I am a full-time research assitant at [Tsinghua University Natural Language Processing Lab (THUNLP)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/site2/index.php/en), advised by [Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). 

Prior to joining THUNLP, I received my B.Eng. Degree in Computer Science & Technology from Zhejiang University City College (ZUCC), had wonderful four years in ZUCC, advised by Lin Sun and Fanwei Zhu. 

**Note that ZUCC is an independent college, far worse than and totally different from Zhejiang University (ZJU)**.

My general research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, and Data Mining.
