I am a first-year PhD student fortunately advised by Prof. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io) at Ohio State University. Before starting my PhD journey, I did NLP research under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) at Tsinghua University, Prof. [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) at Dartmouth College, and Dr. [Daxin Jiang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/djiang/) at Microsoft STCA Semantics and Knowledge Team. Here is my [CV](/files/cv_open.pdf) (updated in Jan 2023).

I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and its real-world applications, currently focusing on Information Extraction and (Large) Language Models.
