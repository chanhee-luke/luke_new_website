I am a second-year PhD student fortunately advised by Prof. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io) at The Ohio State University. 
Here is my [CV](/files/cv_open.pdf).
<!-- Previously, I worked with Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) at Tsinghua University, Prof. [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) at Dartmouth College, and Dr. [Daxin Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-wAHCoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at Microsoft. [Ming-Wei Chang](https://mingweichang.org) at Google DeepMind.-->

I am interested in NLP, Multimodality, and their real-world applications.

## News
