I am a second-year PhD student fortunately advised by Prof. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io) at The Ohio State University. Meanwhile, I am a part-time Student Researcher at Google DeepMind.

<!-- Previously, I worked with Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) at Tsinghua University, Prof. [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) at Dartmouth College, and Dr. [Daxin Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-wAHCoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at Microsoft.-->

<!-- Here is my [CV](/files/cv_open.pdf) (updated in Jan 2023).-->

I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and its real-world applications such as Information Extraction and Information Retrieval. Recently, I am exploring Large Language Models through the lens of Knowledge and Multimodal.

My recent favorite work is [LLM Knowledge Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13300): we explored whether LLMs can successfully use external information (like New Bing and ChatGPT with Internet), especially when that conflicts with what LLMs have in their memory.

## News
