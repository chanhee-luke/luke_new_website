I am a first-year PhD student fortunately advised by Prof. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io) at The Ohio State University. Previously, I worked with Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) at Tsinghua University, Prof. [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) at Dartmouth College, and Dr. [Daxin Jiang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/djiang/) at Microsoft Semantics and Knowledge Team.
<!-- Here is my [CV](/files/cv_open.pdf) (updated in Jan 2023).-->

I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, currently focusing on the interplay between Knowledge and Large Language Models (e.g., better using LLM for knowledge acquisition and using knowledge for enhancing LLM).
