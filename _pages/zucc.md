ZUCC is an independent college, which is neither a branch of ZJU nor one of the campuses of  ZJU. It is directly managed by the People's Government of Zhejiang Province while ZJU belongs to the Ministry of Education of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.



My ZUCC advisors Prof. [Lin Sun](http://jsxy.zucc.edu.cn/art/2020/4/8/art_2788_194362.html) and Prof. [Fanwei Zhu](http://jsxy.zucc.edu.cn/art/2013/4/18/art_265_94143.html) both are Associate Professors at ZUCC and Zhejiang University (ZJU) Master student mentors.

I had wonderful four years in ZUCC.
